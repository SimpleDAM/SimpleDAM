SimpleDAM is a very basic REST-based API standard which defines some core common features which nearly all Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems should support.  For more detailed information, see this DAM News article:  <a href="https://digitalassetmanagementnews.org/features/an-introduction-to-the-simpledam-api-protocol/" target="_blank">https://digitalassetmanagementnews.org/features/an-introduction-to-the-simpledam-api-protocol/</a>

There are two repositories: front-end and back-end.  Most developers will be interested in the front-end files, these provide a test harness to verify compliance of their own application with the SimpleDAM protocol.  The back-end is available as an example (developed in PHP/MySQL).
